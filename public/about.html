  YOU BETTER RUN! She's our friend, and she's crazy! 
  It’s about the shadow monster, isn’t it? 
  Nobody normal ever accomplished anything

  Do you know anything about sensory 
  deprivation tanks? 
  Specifically how to build one? Mouth-breather.

  You act like you want me to be your friend and 
  then you treat me like garbage. 
  Nobody normal ever accomplished anything

  Mornings are for coffee and contemplation. 
  If we’re both going crazy, then we’ll go

  sensory deprivation tanks? 
  Specifically how to build one?
